##  Object Oriented Programming

##  a class vs an object
* An object is an instance of a class
* Class is a blueprint of an object
* An instance is an occurrance of a class


## the stack vs the heap
* In the stack I store scalar value (things with single value, like booleans, numbers, strings, etc), in other words, the value can be represented directly in the memory.
* when I store an array, the stack store the memory address of where this array is stored in the heap.
* Example, when you enter a news website, all visitor see the same news and when there is an update, all of them see it, same goes for memory where the news website address is the address of the memory in the stack, and the content is what is stored in the heap.

## Garbage Collection
* The Garbage Collector clear everything in the heap that doesn't have an address in the stack refering to it
* Garbage collection handles memory allocation safely so that no objects use the contents of another object mistakenly. 
* When a class object is created at runtime, certain memory space is allocated to it in the heap memory. 
* However, after all the actions related to the object are completed in the program, the memory space allocated to it is a waste as it cannot be used. 
* In this case, garbage collection is very useful as it automatically releases the memory space after it is no longer required. 

## static:
* if it is marked as static, it lives at the class level, not the object level.
* If something is marked static, it means that it belongs to the class as a whole, not the individual objects.
* It is shared across all instances. If you change something in the class that is static, it will affect all instances of the class.
