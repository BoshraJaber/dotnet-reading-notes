# Intro to c#: handling errors and exceptions

## Exceptions types:
1. NotImplementedException - Indicates that a method has not yet been implemented.
2. IndexOutOfRangeException - Indicates that an index outside the range of a 3. collection has been referenced
4. InvalidCastException - Indicates that a cast has been attempted on the incorrect object type
5. FormatException - Text was not in the correct format when converting it to something else.
6. NotSupportedException - An action was attempted that was not supported.
7. NullReferenceException - Reference type was null, instead of an object
8. StackOverflowException - Indicates that there is no more room left on the call stack.
9. DivideByZeroException - You can't divide by zero....
10. ArgumentNullException - A required non-null argument provided was null.
11. ArgumentOutOfRangeException - Argument contained a value that was out of range then what it was expecting.

## Notes:
* Error handling is primarily handled through:
 1. try − A try block identifies a block of code for which particular exceptions is activated. It is followed by one or more catch blocks.

 2. catch − A program catches an exception with an exception handler at the place in a program where you want to handle the problem. The catch keyword indicates the catching of an exception.

 3. finally − The finally block is used to execute a given set of statements, whether an exception is thrown or not thrown. For example, if you open a file, it must be closed whether an exception is raised or not.

 4. throw − A program throws an exception when a problem shows up.
