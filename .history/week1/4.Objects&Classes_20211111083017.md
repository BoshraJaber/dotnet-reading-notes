##  Object Oriented Programming

##  a class vs an object
* An object is an instance of a class


## the stack vs the heap
* In the stack I store scalar value (things with single value, like booleans, numbers, strings, etc), in other words, the value can be represented directly in the memory.
* when I store an array, the stack store the memory address of where this array is stored in the heap.
* Example, when you enter a news website, all visiter see the same news

## Garbage Collection
* Garbage collection handles memory allocation safely so that no objects use the contents of another object mistakenly. 
* When a class object is created at runtime, certain memory space is allocated to it in the heap memory. 
* However, after all the actions related to the object are completed in the program, the memory space allocated to it is a waste as it cannot be used. 
* In this case, garbage collection is very useful as it automatically releases the memory space after it is no longer required. 

## static:
* if it is marked as static, it lives at the class level, not the object level.
* If something is marked static, it means that it belongs to the class as a whole, not the individual objects.
* It is shared across all instances. If you change something in the class that is static, it will affect all instances of the class.
