## Garbage Collection
* Garbage collection handles memory allocation safely so that no objects use the contents of another object mistakenly. 


## static:
* if it is marked as static, it lives at the class level, not the object level.
* If something is marked static, it means that it belongs to the class as a whole, not the individual objects.
* It is shared across all instances. If you change something in the class that is static, it will affect all instances of the class.
